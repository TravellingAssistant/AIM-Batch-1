**TOURISM EXPLOREX** The project focuses on solving the challenges faced by travellers when searching 
suitable accommodation, dining options, and places of interest while visiting unfamiliar
locations. The lack of local knowledge and relevant information often leads to suboptimal
choices, resulting in an underwhelming travel experience. The Location-Based Travel
Companion aims to address these issues by providing a reliable, user-friendly platform that
offers comprehensive recommendations tailored to each user's specific needs and
preferences.
